## Match Summary Data
The raw data is available at [Cricsheet website](http://cricsheet.org/downloads/). The processed data has been downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl).
```{r}
matches <- read.csv("data/matches.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
glimpse(matches)
```

## Match Ball by Ball Data
```{r}
ballbyball <- read.csv("data/deliveries1.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
glimpse(ballbyball)
```

## Venue Location Data Processing
```{r}
library("ggmap")
library("rworldmap")
cities<-unlist(matches %>% distinct(city) %>% filter(city != ""))
location<-geocode(cities)
row.names(location)<-cities
location<-location[,2:3]
coord2loc <- function(points)
{
  countriesSP <- getMap(resolution='low')
  pointsSP = SpatialPoints(points, proj4string=CRS(proj4string(countriesSP)))  
  indices = over(pointsSP, countriesSP)
  indices$ADMIN  #returns country name
}
countries<-coord2loc(as.matrix(location))
location[,3]<-countries
location["Kochi",]$V3<-"India"
location[,"city"]<-row.names(location)
glimpse(location)
```
