#'T20 Cricket Data Analysis' <br>Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset<br> By, Ashish Jain
##Ashish Jain

## Cricket

## A test case

The dataset `brfss_iowa.csv` (linked from website) contains 6227 records from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for Iowans.

> The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nation's premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors.

It is conducted annually by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Codebook with detailed explanations of variables is [available here](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2015/pdf/codebook15_llcp.pdf).

## Your turn

You are asked to investigate the relationship between height and weight of Iowans based on the 2015 BRFSS records (see course website for data).
(The variables `WEIGHT2` and `HEIGHT3` are collected during the interview)

In the next 20 mins:

0. Complete the following tasks and **write instructions / documentation** for a collaborator to be able to reproduce your findings.
1. Use your favorite software (IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE R!!!) to come up with a graphical summary of the relationship between weight and height (fix potential problems in the data!). 
2. Write a short report of your findings. 


## Your turn

In the next 10 mins:

1. Introduce yourself to your neighbor. 
2. Swap the report and the instructions / documentation with your collaborator - **BUT DO NOT TALK ABOUT THE DATA OR THE ANALYSIS** (yet)
3. Try to reproduce your neighbor's findings.

Thanks to  Jenny Bryant and Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel for the idea for the original  example!




## How did that go? 

- Where did things get problematic?


## Reflection

- What tools did you use?
- Were you successful in reproducing each others' work? 
<br><br>
- What would happen if your collaborator is no longer available to walk you through 
their analysis?
- What made it easy / hard for reproducing your partners' work?
- What would have to happen if 
    - you had to swap out the dataset or extend the analysis further?
    - you caught further data errors and had to re-create the analysis
    with corrections?
    - you had to revert back to the original dataset?

## Summary

- Everyone struggles with reproducibility and it is a hindrance to moving 
science forward
- Even with a fairly simple analysis challenges were faced in four main areas:
organization, documentation, automation, and dissemination

# Four facets of reproducibility

## Four facets of reproducibility

1. **Documentation:** difference between binary files (e.g. docx) and text files and
why text files are preferred for documentation
    - *Protip:* Use markdown to document your workflow so that anyone can pick up your
    data and follow what you are doing
    - *Protip:* Use literate programming so that your analysis and your results are
    tightly connected, or better yet, unseparable
2. **Organization:** tools to organize your projects so that you don't have a single 
folder with hundreds of files
3. **Automation:** the power of scripting to create automated data analyses
4. **Dissemination:** publishing is not the end of your analysis, rather it is a way 
station towards your future research and the future research of others
