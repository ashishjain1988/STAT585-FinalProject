\section{Introduction}
Cricket is one of the most popular and played sports in India. There are three standard types of cricket matches, Five-day match (Test Match), 50 overs match (One day match), and Twenty overs match (T20). Although all formats are quite popular but during the last decade, the popularity of the T20 matches has increased exponentially. The main reason for the popularity of T20 matches is more action in short time. The introduction of various T20 tournaments has also added to its popularity. Indian Premier League (IPL) is the biggest event among all the T20 tournaments across the globe. It is an annual tournament and consists of two stages. In the first or the league stage, each team plays against the other team twice. In the second stage, the top four teams after the league stage compete for the title. We are going to use the IPL data from the year 2008 to 2016. The raw data is available at [Cricsheet website](http://cricsheet.org/downloads/). The raw data consists ball by ball details individually for every match (577 files). The processed data has been downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl). For carrying out the analysis we divided this project into two parts. In the first part, we further processed the data for its usage in the next part (visualization and analysis). In the next part, we developed a shiny application in which the data is analyzed by plotting and changing various parameters including year, team, and player.

The GitHub repository which I am using for this project is https://github.com/ashishjain1988/STAT585-FinalProject

\section{Dataset}
As mentioned earlier, the IPL dataset has been available at [Cricsheet website](http://cricsheet.org/downloads/). The raw data consists ball by ball details (including bowler, batsmen, run scored, match, and teams.) individually for every match (577 files). These files also consist the meta information about the match including the venue, toss winner, the match winner, stadium, and city. Our aim was first to process the data and make it tidy but this step has already done previously. For our project, we downloaded and used the processed data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl). The processed data consists of two files. The first file, `matches.csv` consists of meta-information about all the matches as described earlier as a comma separated file. The second file, `deliveries.csv` consists of the ball by ball information of the matches. These files have a common identifier called as "match_id" which is the linking key for these two files.

```

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Processing of the dataset}
Although we downloaded the processed data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl), there is still processing we need to do before using the dataset. In our analysis, we want to point each venue of the matches on a world map with the number of matches for a particular team. For this visualization, we need to extract the longitude and latitude for the venues. For this, we used the `ggmap` and `rworldmap` to extract the details. In total, the matches were hosted by 30 different venues across all seasons. By using `ggmap` we extracted the location information and stored in the `location_mapping.csv` the file which is in the data folder.

```
cities<-unlist(matches %>% distinct(city) %>% filter(city != ""))
points<-geocode(cities)
row.names(points)<-cities
points<-points[,2:3]
coord2loc <- function(points)
{
  countriesSP <- getMap(resolution='low')
  pointsSP = SpatialPoints(points, proj4string=CRS(proj4string(countriesSP)))  
  indices = over(pointsSP, countriesSP)
  #indices$continent   # returns the continent (6 continent model)
  #indices$REGION   # returns the continent (7 continent model)
  indices$ADMIN  #returns country name
  #indices$ISO3 # returns the ISO3 code 
}
countries<-coord2loc(as.matrix(points))
points[,3]<-countries
points["Kochi",]$V3<-"India"
write.csv(points,"../data/location_mapping.csv")
#map <- get_map(location = 'India', zoom = 4)
#ggmap(map) + geom_point(aes(x=77.10249,y=28.70406,label="Delhi"))
#mapWorld <- borders("world", colour="gray50", fill="gray50")
#mp <- ggplot() +   mapWorld
#mp <- mp+ geom_point(aes(x=visit.x, y=visit.y) ,color="blue", size=3)
```

\section{Results}
In this section, we will discuss various features of the interactive shiny application which is developed to analyze the IPL dataset. The shiny application has three different tabs which are based on the visualization of data based on IPL season, team, and player.

\subsection{IPL seasons analysis}
In this section, the user can visualize and analyze the data grouped together by the season. The user can use various plots which are described below for a specific season by selecting the season in the select widget. In addition to that, the user can also filter the teams or players by selecting the minimum number of seasons played through the slider bar. Now we talk about the different plots that are there in the shiny application. The shiny page for the season analysis is shown below. 

![Season analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishjain1988/STAT585-FinalProject/master/SeasonPage.png)

\subsubsection{Toss Winner}
This plot compares the count of toss and matches winner across different teams in a season. The information is displayed as a histogram. This plot can be used to see the effect of winning the toss on the match result for teams. The user can also hover over the bars and get the details. For example,

```{r, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60)}
Toss<-matches %>% filter(season == 2008) %>% group_by(toss_winner) %>% count() %>% mutate(winner = toss_winner) %>% select(-toss_winner)
Match<-matches %>% filter(season == 2008,toss_winner == winner) %>% group_by(winner) %>% filter(winner != "") %>%count()
Toss$name<-"1. Toss"
Match$name<-"2. Match"
team_seasons<-matches %>% gather(key=team,value=teamname,c(5:6)) %>% distinct(season,teamname) %>% group_by(teamname) %>% count() %>% filter(n>=1)
stat_data_toss<-rbind(Toss,Match) %>% filter(winner %in% team_seasons$teamname)
gg<-ggplot(stat_data_toss, aes(winner,n, fill = name)) + geom_histogram(position = "dodge",stat = "identity") +
      ggtitle(paste("Number of tosses and matches won by the teams in", 2008, "season and played at least",1,"seasons")) +
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + xlab("Teams") + ylab("#Matches")
gg
```

\subsubsection{Comparison of total matches played and won}

\subsubsection{Location Impact}
This plot contains the information about the matches won by a team at a particular venue. The information is displayed by using `ggmap`. The plot maps the location of the venue by plotting the longitude and latitude on a world map and labeling the number of matches played and won at that location. For example the plot below show the location where Gujrat Lions played. The labels consists of the venue name, number of matches played and won.
```
teamName<-"Gujarat Lions"
matchPlayed <- matches %>% gather(key=team,value=teamname,c(5:6)) %>% filter(teamname == teamName) 
%>% select(teamname,city) %>% group_by(city) %>% count()
matchWon <- matches %>% filter(winner == teamName) %>% select(winner,city) %>%group_by(city) 
%>% count()
names(matchPlayed)<-c("city","Matches.Played")
df<-data.frame(setdiff(matchPlayed$city,matchWon$city),0)
names(df)<-c("city","n")
dd<-rbind(matchWon,df)
names(dd)<-c("city","Matches.Won")
matchl<-merge(matchPlayed,dd,by.x="city",by.y="city")
matchlocation<-merge(matchl,location,by.x="city",by.y="city")
map <- get_map(location = unique(matchlocation$V3), zoom = 4)
ggmap(map) + geom_point(data = matchlocation,aes(x=lon,y=lat)) +
  geom_label_repel(data = matchlocation,aes(lon, lat, label = paste(city,Matches.Played,Matches.Won)),
  fontface = 'bold', color = 'red',box.padding = unit(0.35, "lines"),point.padding = unit(0.5, "lines"),segment.color = 'grey50') +
  theme_classic(base_size = 10)
```

runs_by_season<-ballbyball %>% filter(player == batsman) %>% group_by(Season,match_id) %>% summarise(totalscore = sum(batsman_runs))
ggplot(runs_by_season, aes(x=Season, y = totalscore,fill = factor(Season))) + geom_boxplot() +
      ggtitle(paste("Total Runs for", player, "across all seasons")) +
        xlab("Season") + ylab("#Runs")
```

\subsubsection{Player of match awards}
This plot compares the player of the match award by a player across the seasons. The information is displayed as a histogram. This plot can be used to check the impact of the player in a particular season.

\subsubsection{Total Wickets}
This plot compares the number of wickets taken by a bowler across seasons. This plot can be used to check the performance of the bowler by checking his bowling performance across the seasons. The user can also hover over the points and get the information about the number of wickets in a particular season.

\section{Future Work}
We have carried out a very basic analysis of the IPL dataset. We can investigate this dataset by carrying out different analysis in order to know more about the performance of the different teams and players across different seasons. The analysis of this dataset can be used by the team owners to select players in future for their teams.
